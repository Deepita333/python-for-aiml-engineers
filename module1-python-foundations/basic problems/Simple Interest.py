# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: (Principal * Rate * Time)/100.
# Use a principal of 5000, a rate of 3.5 (percent), and a time of 4 (years). Print the final interest amount.
principal = 5000
rate = 3.5
time = 4

# Calculate simple interest
interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
