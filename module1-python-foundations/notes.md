# Module 1: Python Foundations

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- Use Python variables, data types, and operators
- Work with core data structures
- Write reusable functions

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

### Installing Python
- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Recommended IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

### Check if Python is Installed

To check if you have Python installed:

### On Linux
```bash
python --version
```
### On macOS
```bash
python3 --version
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Your First Python Program
Let's write our first Python file, called program.py, which can be created in any text editor:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Simple as that. Save your file.

### Running the Program
Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
```bash
python hello.py
```
Expected Output:
Hello, World!

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Python Indentation
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

- In other programming languages, indentation is for readability only.

- In Python, indentation is very important because it defines code blocks.

Example
```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
```
If you skip indentation, Python will give an error:

Example(Invalid)
```python
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
```
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Python Comments
Comments can be used to:

- Explain Python code

- Make the code more readable

- Prevent execution when testing

### Creating a Comment
Comments start with # and Python will ignore them.
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Multiline Comments
Python does not have a dedicated syntax for multiline comments.

Option 1: Use # for each line
```python
# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Option 2: Use Multiline Strings
Since Python ignores string literals not assigned to a variable, you can use triple quotes:

```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Variables 
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.

- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

### Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

```python 
x = 5
print(x)
y = "Deepita"
print(y)
```
### Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
### One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
```python
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Python Data Types
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

## 1. Basic (Built-in) Data Types

| Type        | Example         | Description                                   |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **int**     | `42`           | Whole numbers (positive, negative, zero).     |
| **float**   | `3.14`         | Numbers with decimals.                        |
| **complex** | `2 + 3j`       | Complex numbers with real & imaginary parts.  |
| **str**     | `"Hello"`      | Text/strings.                                  |
| **bool**    | `True`, `False`| Boolean values (logical truth).               |
| **NoneType**| `None`         | Represents ‚Äúno value‚Äù or null.                |

---

## 2. Sequence Types

| Type      | Example         | Description                     |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **list**  | `[1, 2, 3]`    | Ordered, mutable collection.    |
| **tuple** | `(1, 2, 3)`    | Ordered, immutable collection.  |
| **range** | `range(5)`     | Sequence of numbers.            |

---

## 3. Set Types

| Type         | Example                 | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **set**      | `{1, 2, 3}`            | Unordered, unique elements.        |
| **frozenset**| `frozenset({1, 2, 3})` | Like `set` but immutable.          |

---

## 4. Mapping Type

| Type    | Example                               | Description              |
|---------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **dict**| `{"name": "Deepita", "age": 21}`      | Key‚Äìvalue pairs.         |

---

## 5. Binary Types

| Type          | Example                                | Description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **bytes**     | `b"hello"`                             | Immutable sequence of bytes.     |
| **bytearray** | `bytearray([65, 66, 67])`              | Mutable sequence of bytes.       |
| **memoryview**| `memoryview(b"hello")`                 | View of memory without copying.  |

---

### note: 
You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
```python
x = 5
print(type(x))
```
output will be : 
<class 'int'>
```python
x = "Hello World"
print(type(x))
```
output will be: <class 'str'>

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Python Operators

In Python, **operators** are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

| `is not` | `x is not y`      | True if they refer to different objects |

---

## Example Code

```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y)      # Arithmetic ‚Üí 10 + 5 = 15
print(x > y)      # Comparison ‚Üí 10 > 5 ‚Üí True
print(x and y)    # Logical AND (non-boolean values)
                  # In Python, 'and' returns the last truthy value
                  # Since both 10 and 5 are truthy ‚Üí returns 5
print(x & y)      # Bitwise AND
                  # 10 = 1010 (binary)
                  #  5 = 0101 (binary)
                  # AND = 0000 (binary) = 0
print("a" in "apple")  # Membership ‚Üí 'a' is in "apple" ‚Üí True

```
